# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  * I feel pretty confident with using the each method. Going through the lesson together in our small group really helped me understand the concept. I feel like even though I won't know how to construct the code in every scenario requiring the each method, I will at least know where to start and can build from there.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * I enjoyed this lesson, mainly because we got to go through it together in our small group, but also because it brought together previous lessons. I know I'm still just barely scratching the surface, but seeing how the pieces are starting to connect will help me moving forward. I would say when I was going through the pre-class work, I was having unproductive struggle. I would get stuck on every example, and then try to google the answer. Googling sometimes helped, and I could write a code that worked, but had zero understanding of what was happening (so then just stuck on the next one!). During the live lesson I had productive struggle and felt like I could navigate through the areas I didn't understand with my classmates and Aurora's help of course.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I would like more challenges to run through that will require using other methods within the each code block. I could probably search other scenarios online and try running them through my terminal.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * I am still struggling to understand how to find or explain the return value. I do now know it is NOT the same thing as the output! I plan to go back through my lessons and see what I missed or glossed over (I think I just made an assumption return value = output). If I still don't understand after going through those, I will ask and also do some research.
